# Aurora

Aurora is a simple HTML page that allows you to load and edit Lucid Dream Diary (.ldd) files. It does not require a server, but can be run on one without privacy concerns (as all data remains local).

Since it runs on the client, you can use it [directly from GitHub](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/krateng/aurora/blob/master/dreams.html)!
