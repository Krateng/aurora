TO THE UNFORTUNATE SOULS WHO MIGHT ONE DAY STUMBLE UPON THIS AND DECIDE TO USE,
OR WORSE, CHANGE IT

I started this nonsense when I understood nothing of Javascript and less of CSS.
I now understand exactly as much CSS and barely more Javascript. Certainly enough
to realize what an atrocity I have built, yet not enough to find the motivation
in me to rebuild the architecture in an elegant and beautiful manner that surely
would reduce this whole program to about 30 lines of code. You have been warned.
Please don't judge my coding ability or my character based on this project. I'm
just too lazy to restructure something when it works (unless it's in Python, then
I restructure things just because I consider it great fun doing so).

With this warning, I hold myself blameless for mental damage caused by reading
this code, as well as all indirect consequences including global thermonuclear
war, Prussian dominance in Germany, FÃ«anor's Curse and Tzuyu being kicked out of
TWICE.

May Javascript be ever in your favor, for it's certainly not in mine.
